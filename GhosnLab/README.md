# Ghosn Lab scripts for Batch effect analysis

The scripts take care of the Batch integration of mutliple data sets from different single cell RNAseq batches-\

1. SBSTSeurat.R - Seurat pipeline for integration of PBMCs generated from the same batch of sequencing\
2. DSD_Liger.R - Liger pipeline for integration of PBMCs generated in different sequencing depths and days\
3. DDS_NoBC_Seurat.R - Seurat pipeline for integrating without using the pipelines tools to counter batch effects\
4. DB_Harmony.R - Mutiple batch integration for PBMCs integrated through Harmony pipeline\
