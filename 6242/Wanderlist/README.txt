Upon user input which includes start date, origin, destination and budget, our tool creates a three-day itinerary with places of interests, restaurants and a hotel for the users to stay in that are optimized by the budget provided. The places of interest and restaurants to visit are clustered based on similar locations in such a way that the users need for travel is minimized. 

Post completion of analysis, the required data is returned in comma separated files. The values from the files are read into the required HTML pages to display the HTML pages (Google Maps visualization and Itinerary page). However, since the web interface could not be completed, especially the interlinking of the application and the ability of the webpages to read in CSV inputs and submit input variable to the code, the code was run manually for all the input. 

The final HTML submitted include the 15 itinerary samples and 5 Google Map visualizations for 5 cities. The 15 itinerary samples are for 5 cities for 3 budget ranges. As mentioned above, since the HTML pages were not able to read in CSV values at the time of submission, the values were entered manually for each of the files. Thus all the HTMLs were created manually for the sake of creation of a sample output set. These output pages were submitted in the code set submitted alongside the Report. The code runs optimally on Mozilla Firefox, not on Google Chrome. The output is available in a folder names ‘front end’.
