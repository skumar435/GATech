1. Ease to develop
Plotly-python: Utilizes minimal constructs, easy
D3: Complex constructs in js, steep learning curve

2. Ease to maintain visualization
Plotly-python: Can be maintained to a fair amount using libraries
D3: Fairly easy to maintain with all functions provided in the file

3. Usability of visualization developed for end users
Plotly-python: Interactivity is limited
D3: Highly interactive

4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets
Plotly-python: Scalable to a good extent
D3: Efficient to handle millions of records

5. System requirements to run the visualization
Plotly-python: Open source
D3: Open source
